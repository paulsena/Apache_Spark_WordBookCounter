# Apache Spark Word Counter

Created to start learning Apache Spark

Counts all occurrences of words from multiple books using Map Filter Reduce techniques.
Ability to run multiple instances of class and save/load word counts between program runs.
Requires Java 8 since it makes use of Lambda expressions, making the Functional-esq code a lot easier to read.
Also makes use of Java 8's Streams, and multiple exception catching features.

In the future, I would like to play around with Spark's Streaming capabilities for real time input and have it word count Twitter posts.  Search and count twitter hash tags for a given Geo Location.  Could then write a simple web interface to show a visual tag cloud. Later on, could play around with Spark's Machine Learning libraries on the dataset.
