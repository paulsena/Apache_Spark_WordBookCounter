/**
 * Apache Spark Word Counter
 *
 * Counts all occurrences of words from multiple books using Map Filter Reduce techniques.
 * Ability to run multiple instances of class and save/load word counts between program runs.
 * Requires Java 8 since it makes use of Lambda expressions, making the Functional-esq code a lot easier to read.
 * Also makes use of Java 8's Streams, and multiple exception catching features.
